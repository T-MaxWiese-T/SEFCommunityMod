Servername: "SEFC Beta www.swat4.tk" -> Server IP address: 195.201.217.123:30480   
The server should also be displayed in the serverbrowser if the filters are set correctly and the masterserverpatch is installed.

*If you want to create your own temporary server with your teammates check out my top Gameranger guide.

*If someone wants to host a server he should write in the SEF Community Discord and you can meet there to play. You can also send in server ip addresses or room names for Gameranger that are temporary.
