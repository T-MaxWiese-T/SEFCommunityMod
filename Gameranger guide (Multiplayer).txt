## MULTIPLAYER WITH GameRanger to play with friends (preferred): ##

BOTH PLAYERS will need to do the following:  
1. Download and install GameRanger. It can be found at http://gameranger.com  Next, GameRanger will automatically detect "SWAT 4" and "SWAT 4: The Stetchkov Syndicate", if all is OK. You may need to manually detect these, if GameRanger doesn't do it for you. 
2. Then, you will need to modify the "Stetchkov Syndicate" game in Gameranger so it points to the Swat4X.exe file in **SEFCommunityModv7/Extras/Swat4X.exe** (Edit -> Options -> Games ->  "Stetchkov Syndicate" -> "Browse..." and then set the location to your SEF Community Mod folder to the **"SWAT4X.exe"** in **"Extras"**.  
(Side note: I also recommend to go to the **"Network"** tab in the Options and set the connection speed to **"2Mbps DSL/Cable"** so that the connection is faster and more stable when playing.) Also, I recommend having **"LAN"** selected in the **SEF Community Mod settings** so that you have the fastest connection.

THE HOST will need to do the following: 
1. Create a game room in Gameranger with **"Host"**, as a "SWAT 4: The Stetchkov Syndicate game". (TIP: if this is going to be a publicly joinable game, be sure to mention it's using the SEF Community mod and specify the version!) 
2. When enough players have joined, press the **"Start"** button. This will launch the SEF Community Mod. 
3. From here, go to the **"Host Game"** in game menu and start up a server (LAN must be selected!) . Important Note: Do not launch as a dedicated server while using GameRanger. Teammates can see your server in the game serverbrowser if they have selected **"LAN"**.

YOUR TEAMMATES will need to do the following: 
1. Join a public room, or your friend's room and then press "Join" that will opens SEF Community Mod. 
2. Press in the main menu "Join Game" and then  select "LAN" in the in game serverbrowser and you can then see and join the server. That's all you really need to do.


### TROUBLESHOOTING ###
**NOTE: If you have the mod installed incorrectly, LaunchSEF.exe won't work!**

Make sure you have the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Redistributable. It is required to run LaunchSEF.exe and other applications. Download it here:

* **64-bit Windows:** https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746572
* **32-bit Windows:** https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746571

If GameRanger "aborts" when it launches, you may have some application (antivirus?) interfering with LaunchSEF.exe. If this happens, copy all .exe and .dll files from `ContentExpansion/System` into `SEF/System` and point GameRanger to the Swat4X.exe that is in `SEF/System`. This is kind of an ultra last resort option however!
